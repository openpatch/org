Before we start with our journey in rewriting OpenPatch, we want to discuss
one important issue first: How to get the community involved?

The old codebase of OpenPatch is currently hosted on GitLab
(https://gitlab.com/openpatch). Even though GitLab is a great platform and we
love the integration of pipelines and the container registry, we are not
feeling the connection to the community. Simple things like not being able to
get involved in the Hacktoberfest (https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
are a real bummer. Also, many possible contributors are not on GitLab and
therefore are more hesitant to contribute.

By moving away from GitLab to GitHub we are hoping to get the community more
involved. Also with the introduction of GitHub Actions and GitHub Packages,
which are comparable to GitLab pipelines and container registry, we are
probably not missing out on many usability aspects.

If you want to know more about the reasoning behind our move to GitHub or our
experience with GitLab, feel free to leave a comment.
