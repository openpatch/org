During the last years, we have developed an open platform for assessment and
training of skills. We started with a simple idea. We just wanted to have an
online platform, which we could use for our research projects. Over time the
idea grew and new features were added to the platform. Instead of just
beginning a private platform for our studies, we have opened it to also be a
social network for sharing tasks and tests. Even though we have started with
a microservice architecture and could adapt to many new requirements, we
think it is time to rewrite the entire platform. This should help us to focus
on our vision, which has formed the last years. To document the process we
will try to write these Devlogs from time to time. These will not be
tutorials but rather a documentation about the rewrite. They could be
focussing on technical decisions, on design discussion, present
architectures, or focus on rather small problems we will encounter by
rewriting OpenPatch.

So if you are interested in seeing how this rewrite is processing over the
next months, be sure to follow us.

If you want to see the current code base of OpenPatch, which is built around
Flask, MariaDB, and NextJS be sure to check out our GitLab-Repository
